  headline: VISION
  content: "- Active learning is any learning exercise in which the student engages
    or interacts with the learning process instead of passively taking in the information.<br><br>-
    Studies have shown that active learning exercise during the lecture helps students
    absorb the lecture material much better. Similarly, in-class feedback on any issue
    (e.g. have you understood topic taught) is an important input to help improve
    learning during lectures.<br><br>- The challenge is how to do the Active Learning
    exercises or take feedback without breaking the flow of lecture or losing control.<br><br>ALT
    (Active Learning and Teaching) is a mobile App that allows active-learning quizzes
    and feedback during the lectures - the quizzes and feedback questions are given
    to students as part of the lecture <em>(so it does not break the faculty member's
    flow and does not require entering them on mobile), </em>while providing instant
    summaries on the phone."

  headline: Built With Privacy in Mind
  content: "<p>A special feature of the app is that the system keeps <em>minimal information
    about the people and quizzes/feedback at the backend.</em></p><p>- The quiz/feedback
    questions are not even entered in the app. The answers to quizzes (or feedback
    questions) are not saved in the backend - they are processed for summarization,
    and then the detailed record is mailed to the faculty as csv (only the result
    of the last quiz is kept due to technical design).</p><p>- At the end of the course,
    the student/instructor can delete their account, and their records in the backend
    will also be deleted.</p><p><em>This enhances privacy and security (as no records
    are kept, even a hacker cannot get them!)</em></p>"
