  content: "<strong>Active learning is any learning exercise in which the student
    engages or interacts with the learning process instead of passively taking in
    the information. Studies have shown that active learning during the lecture helps
    students absorb the lecture material better. The challenge is how to do the Active
    Learning exercises to strengthen student's learning during the lecture, without
    losing control. ALT (Active Learning and Teaching) is a mobile App that allows
    active-learning quizzes during the lectures, as well as getting quick feedback
    from students.</strong>"
