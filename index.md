  headline: Built With Privacy in Mind
  content: A special feature of the app is that it keeps <strong>minimal information</strong>
    about the courses and performance in quizzes.<br>For each quiz or feedback, it
    sends the detailed record (of responses of each student) on email (to the address
    specified by the instructor) and <strong>keeps no records.</strong><br>At the
    end of the course, the student/instructor can<strong> delete their account</strong>,
    and no record of the quizzes/feedback is kept in the server (other than statistical
    data for research on Active Learning). This <strong>enhances privacy</strong>
    (as no records are kept, even a hacker cannot get them!)
