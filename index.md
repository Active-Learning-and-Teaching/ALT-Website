    content: <br><br>An Instructor can easily create a course by providing the course
      name. A unique invite code is generated for the course that can be shared with
      the students. The dashboard shows the ongoing courses of the instructor. The
      instructor can post announcements <span class="il">and</span> manage students
      and can also specify email addresses for receiving responses to the quizzes
      and feedback. The app does not require any IT infrastructure support and thus
      can be used in any teacher-class setting (Schools, Colleges, Workshops).

    content: <br><br>Short in-class quizzes are the key to Active Learning in lectures.
      An instructor can host in-class quizzes instantly to test the understanding
      of students. The quiz questions will be shown to students in the class as part
      of the presentation so that the instructor does not have to enter the quiz questions
      manually on the phone. The instructor can choose the type of quiz and set the
      duration for it. A summary of the quiz responses is presented to the instructor
      and the students at the end of the quiz on the phone. The student responses
      are auto-graded <span class="il">and</span> sent as CSV to the email specified
      by the instructor.

    headline: Take Instant Feedback
    content: <br><br>The instructor can conduct instant student feedbacks during the
      lecture. The feedback question is presented in class as part of the presentation
      <span class="il">and</span> the students can give their anonymous feedback on
      the app. The instructor can choose the feedback type as Color-Scale or a Likert
      Scale and can set the duration of the feedback. The anonymous student responses
      are mailed to the instructor. A small summary of feedback is also shown in the
      app. This can be used to improve the learning environment and understand how
      well is the audience grasping key concepts.

  headline: Vision
  content: Active learning is any learning exercise in which the student engages or
    interacts with the learning process instead of passively taking in the information.
    Studies have shown that active learning exercise during the lecture helps students
    absorb the lecture material much better. Similarly, in-class feedback on any issue
    is an important input to help improve learning during lectures. The challenge
    is how to conduct the Active Learning exercises or take feedback without breaking
    the flow of lectures or losing control. <br><br>ALT (Active Learning and Teaching)
    is a mobile App that allows active learning through instant quizzes and feedback
    during lectures. The quizzes and feedback questions are given to students as part
    of the lecture without breaking the flow of the class. The students can respond
    on the app and the results are summarised by the app for the faculty to understand
    the state of class and engagement.

  headline: Built with Privacy in Mind
  content: The app aims to promote data privacy and security by keeping minimal information.
    The instructor does not have to enter the questions of quizzes and feedbacks on
    the app. The student responses are removed from the backend after being processed
    for summarization. A copy of the responses is mailed to the instructor as CSV
    for grading. At the end of the course, the student/instructor can delete their
    account along with all the data associated with their account.
