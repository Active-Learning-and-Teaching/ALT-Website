      by providing the course name. A unique invite code is generated for the course
      that can be shared with the students. The students can join a course using the
      respective invite code. The dashboard shows the ongoing courses of the instructor.
      The instructors can post announcements <span class="il">and</span> manage students
      in their courses. They can also specify email addresses for receiving responses
      to the quizzes and feedback. The app does not require any IT infrastructure
      support and thus can be used in any teacher-class setting (Schools, Colleges,
      Workshops).

      in-class quizzes are the key to Active Learning in lectures. An instructor can
      host in-class quizzes instantly to test the understanding of students. The quiz
      questions will be shown to students in the class as part of the presentation
      so that the instructor does not have to enter the quiz questions manually on
      the phone. The instructor can choose the type of the quiz as Multiple-Choice
      Single-Correct, Multiple-choice Multi-Correct or Alphanumeric and set the duration
      for it. A summary of the quiz responses is presented to the faculty and the
      students at the end of the quiz on the phone. The student responses to quizzes
      are auto-graded (if answers are provided by the instructor) <span class="il">and</span>
      sent as CSV to the email specified by the faculty.

      A small summary of feedback is also shown in the app. This can be used to improve
      the learning environment and understand how well is the audience grasping key
      concepts.</em>

  content: Active learning is any learning exercise in which the student engages or
    interacts with the learning process instead of passively taking in the information.
    Studies have shown that active learning exercise during the lecture helps students
    absorb the lecture material much better. Similarly, in-class feedback on any issue
    is an important input to help improve learning during lectures. The challenge
    is how to conduct the Active Learning exercises or take feedback without breaking
    the flow of lectures or losing control.<br><br>ALT (Active Learning and Teaching)
    is a mobile App that allows active learning through instant quizzes and feedback
    during lectures. The quizzes and feedback questions are given to students as part
    of the lecture without breaking the flow of the class. The students can respond
    on the app and the results are summarised by the app for the faculty to understand
    the state of class and engagement.

    and thereby promotes data privacy and security.</p><p>The quiz/feedback questions
    are not entered in the app. The answers to quiz/feedback questions are processed
    for summarization and mailed to the faculty as CSV. The data of quizzes and feedbacks
    are removed from the backend after processing. At the end of the course, the student/instructor
    can delete their account, and their records in the backend will also be deleted.</p>"
